Dimensional Drawing
===================

Dimensional Drawing is a collaborative 3D drawing space. Technically it is 2.5D, because the images are in layers. It is a [Couch Application](http://couchapp.org/), powered by [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) and hosted by [Iris Couch](http://www.iriscouch.com/) at http://www.dimensionaldrawing.com/

Features
--------

* Infinite tiled drawing canvas. Pan with click and drag.

* Canvases layered to form the 3rd dimension. Scroll through these using a scroll wheel on a mouse or two-finger scrolling on a trackpad. On a touch sensitive device (iPad, etc) this scrolling is done by pinching, and panning is done with two-finger gestures.

* Color picker with hue, saturation, value, opacity, and brush size.

* Eraser tool.

* Eyedropper tool.

* Location hashes allow particular locations to be bookmarked.

* Near real time updates of what other users are drawing.
